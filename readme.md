Project Name
Portfolio: details popup window

Description.
For this project, I added the JavaScript, HTML and CSS linter.

For this milestone of my portfolio website, I implemented a popup window that includes the project details in both desktop and mobile. In order to do that, I needed to store the information about your projects in a JavaScript object.

I implemented the following interactions:

-When the user clicks (or taps) the button to check project details, the popup with details about the project appears.
-When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the popup disappears.
