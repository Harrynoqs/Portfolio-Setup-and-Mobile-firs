Project Name
Portfolio: Preserve data in the browser

Description.
For this project, I added the JavaScript, HTML and CSS linter.

For this final milestone of your portfolio website, I saved the form data in the local storage of the browser. That way when the user reloads the page the data they filled out in the form will be preserved.

I implemented the following interactions:

‚û§ When the user changes the content of any input field, the data is saved to the local storage.
‚û§ When the user loads the page, if there is any data in the local storage the input fields are pre-filled with this data.
