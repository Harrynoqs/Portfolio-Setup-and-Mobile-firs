Project Name
Portfolio: validate contact form

Description.
For this project, I added the JavaScript, HTML and CSS linter.

For this milestone of your portfolio website, I implemented a client-side validation of the data in the contact form before submission.

I implemented the following interactions:

- When the user submits the form, I check if the email is in lower case.
- If the validation is OK, the form is sent.
- If the validation is not OK, there is an error message to the user near the submit button informing
  them of the error and the form is not sent.
